
# Write a fizzBuzz() function with a single integer parameter named upTo. 
# For the numbers 1 up to and including upTo, the function prints one of four things:
"""
路   Prints 'FizzBuzz' if the number is divisible by 3 and 5.
路   Prints 'Fizz' if the number is only divisible by 3.
路   Prints 'Buzz' if the number is only divisible by 5.
路   Prints the number if the number is neither divisible by 3 nor 5.
"""
# Instead of printing each string or number on a separate line, print them without newlines. 
# For example, your solution is correct if calling fizzBuzz(35) produces the following output:
# 1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz Fizz 7 8 Fizz Buzz 11 Fizz 13 14 FizzBuzz 16 17 Fizz 19 Buzz Fizz 22 23 Fizz Buzz 26 Fizz 28 29 FizzBuzz 31 32 Fizz 34 Buzz

# Try to write a solution based on the information in this description. 
# If you still have trouble solving this exercise, read the Solution Design and Special Cases and Gotchas sections for additional hints.

# Prerequisite concepts: modulo operator, end keyword argument for print(), for loops, range() with two arguments
